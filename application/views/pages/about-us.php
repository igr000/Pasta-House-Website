             <p class="w3-large">Authentic Italian culture places great importance on family values, and so does The Pasta House Co. Our mission to create a family-friendly Italian restaurant set our standard in 1974 when we opened our doors and has remained a top priority ever since. Over the last 40 years, we’ve worked diligently to create a dining atmosphere that is focused on serving families. Through our daily specials like Kids Eat Free Sundays to happy hour, we strive to offer an affordable dining menu that offers a relaxed and welcoming experience to families. Our purpose has led The Pasta House Co. to become a beloved St. Louis tradition. For years, The Pasta House Co. has been celebrating birthdays, anniversaries and other special occasions with your family. And it’s our honor to do so. Beyond the in-house dining experience, we have developed programs and implemented philanthropic values into our culture, which are focused on the family unit. Whether it’s hosting a fundraiser or donating to our Caring & Sharing Program, our dedication to the family is rooted in all of our actions. We invite you to join us at our house to dine, and please be sure to bring the kids!</p>
